        <p>On Thursday 27th June 2019, our beloved Sully Dog walked into the sunset for the last time. He was only six years old and developed an auto-immune illness called thrombocytopenia, common in middle-aged spaniels. Though devastated by his loss, we want to remember the good times, and this site is a tribute to him. Love you buddy, won't be long.</p>

        <p>When we got Sully in 2013, I (having never had a dog) had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself in for. Now, after saying goodbye for a final time after a whirlwind six years, I can reflect on the impact he had our lives, and I wouldn't change a thing. He touched a lot of lives - friends, family, neighbours, he had ten times more friends than me - but for my wife and I, we've lost an absolute constant in our lives. So thank you Sully for seeing us through the hard times, and for making the good times better than we could have otherwise dreamed. And now, while we wait for a pain greater than we could have ever imagined to fade, we would like to remember him in happy times, of which there were so, so many. Good boy.</p>

        <p>So here's to our forever best friend. He had to wait a few years to see it, but he loved the snow...</p>
